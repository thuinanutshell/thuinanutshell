## Hello, I'm ThÆ° ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ I tinker and play with data and software

âœ¨ I love benchmarking stuff

ğŸŒ± Passionate about scalable software, data infra, and ML/AI systems

ğŸ’¬ My fav algo is backtracking because it reminds me that: *"I do, I fail, I go back and try something else."*

ğŸ˜„ When I'm not coding, you can see me doing origami, reading horror books, or doing things I suck at :)
